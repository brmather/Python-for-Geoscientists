Please note:

This file contains a tab-delimited text file containing data for all samples in the EarthChem Portal
for which a sample value exists.

While there are 438,593 samples represented in the file, there are actually
467,841 rows. This is due to the fact that some samples have more than one
material analyzed. Each material has its own row.

Please contact me if there are any question.
